QON:4:The time complexity, also tell the worst case of the binary search O(n), and print that numbers ?
/////////
ANS:
Time Complexity of Binary Search:

The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the sorted array. This is because binary search divides the search space in half at each step, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.

Worst-Case Scenario:

The worst-case scenario for binary search occurs when the target element is not present in the array, and the algorithm has to search the entire array. Even in this case, the time complexity remains O(log n), because the algorithm still divides the search space in half at each step.

Printing Numbers:

To demonstrate the binary search algorithm, let's consider an example array:

arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]

Suppose we want to search for the number 23. Here's how the binary search algorithm would work:

1. Start with the middle element: arr[4] = 16
2. Compare 23 with 16: 23 is greater, so move to the right half.
3. New middle element: arr[6] = 38
4. Compare 23 with 38: 23 is smaller, so move to the left half.
5. New middle element: arr[5] = 23
6. Compare 23 with 23: match found!

Here's some sample Python code to demonstrate the binary search algorithm:


def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        print(f"Mid index: {mid}, Mid value: {arr[mid]}")

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1  # Target not found

arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]
target = 23
result = binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Target {target} found at index {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Target {target} not found in the array.")


When you run this code, it will print the mid index and mid value at each step of the binary search algorithm. The output will look something like this:


Mid index: 4, Mid value: 16
Mid index: 6, Mid value: 38
Mid index: 5, Mid value: 23
Target 23 found at index 5.
